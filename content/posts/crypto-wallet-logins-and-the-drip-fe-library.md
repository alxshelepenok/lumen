The day has come! As of today, you can sign up or sign in to Fleek with **an Ethereum wallet. Powered by Sign in With Ethereum, and built using the Drip component library for Web3 apps that we’re also open-sourcing today!**

We hinted at this release last week, with the authentication page overhaul, and today we’re not only releasing one option but four different Ethereum wallet authentication providers.  
It’s time to **welcome blockchain & crypto users into Fleek, the dApp way.**

This is the first of many steps towards a Web3 rehaul to Fleek, bringing you wallet-based accounts and soon a non-custodial first experience.

## Ethereum Authentication on Fleek ⚡

If you visit [app.fleek.co](https://app.fleek.co/), you’ll find a new Sign in with Ethereum option, next to the Git or Email provider options!

For this new authentication option, we brought in **four main Ethereum provider options that you know and love:**

* MetaMask 🦊
* Rainbow 🌈
* Wallet Connect 🤝
* Gnosis Multi-Sig 🔒

From any Web3 enthusiast or solo developer to DAOs or multi-sig that want decentralized control of their Fleek account and projects. We’re getting ready to welcome them all!

### Using MetaMask 🦊

With MetaMask, it takes a couple of clicks to use your extension wallet to authenticate to Fleek.

### Using Rainbow, Gnosis, or Wallet Connect 🌈

For these three wallets, all it takes is a QR scan to get started!

Users can create **new wallet-only accounts; or use the flow shown below to link a wallet to an existing GitHub or email account:**

## The Drip Library 💧

![](https://storageapi.fleek.co/fleek-team-bucket/drip.png)

To prepare for the rebuild of the Fleek UI into a friendlier Web3 experience, we created the **open-source Drip library and design system. Drip is built on React with core styling libraries under the hood (Radix/Stitches)** that ensure the best UI/UX and accessibility possible.

From our end, we want to be efficient and speedy about our new dApp's development. From the community's perspective? We want to share components, layouts, and resources useful for **any developer building Web3 dApps.**

It begins with a set of components that we’ve used in rebuilding Fleek (e.g. the Web3 authentication layout), and it will evolve to a **shopify-esque type of library where developers can find resources for creating any type of dApp.** We will use it to power the UIs of different Fleek / Psychedelic projects going forward, growing the library with different repurposable layouts.
